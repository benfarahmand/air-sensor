# air-sensor
 Working on an air quality sensor with MQ-2, MQ-3, MQ-4, MQ-5, MQ-6, MQ-7, MQ-8, MQ-9, and MQ-135


Credits:
- To understand how to convert voltage values to PPM, I borrowed from https://github.com/tutRPi/Raspberry-Pi-Gas-Sensor-MQ


To Do:
- better understand how calibration works to set the Ro value
- implement equation to change Rs/Ro based on temperature and humidity
- need to connect the temperature and humidity sensor
- get a carbon dioxide sensor
- get a Particulate Matter sensor
